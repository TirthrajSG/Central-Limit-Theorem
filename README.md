# Central Limit Theorem Simulation in Python

This repository contains a Python simulation demonstrating the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**. The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the original distribution.
